Received help from Nick Gurnard to debug Blinn-Phong surface shader issue.

Helped Nick Gurnard formulate math behind a vertex deformation shader to get mario to fit into a conical shape.
Also discussed high-level concepts regarding what to do in vertex shader vs. fragement shader and he helped me 
review the notes to clear up my understanding in this area.

Recieved help from TA Lorant regarding how to avoid subtle black border surrounding gaussian post-process filter.
Ultimately clipped indices to texture dimensions.

Used shadertoy example by IQ here: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MslGD8
as inspiration for my worley noise post-process shader. Went beyond just implementing it and added functionality to
sample original texture color at vornoi point location and apply it to the entire worley cell. Also went on to include
chromatic abberation and unique time-functions to transition between various cell sizes, amounts of abberation, etc.
